### Hi there! 👋

I'm a **Web Developer** specializing in **Front-End Development** and **User Experience Design**. I’m passionate about building user-friendly, engaging interfaces that make a difference. 

Beyond web development, I also love diving into **data analysis** and creating **data visualizations** that turn complex data into meaningful insights.

In my free time, you’ll likely find me enjoying some **Chinese** or **Japanese noodles**! 🍜

Feel free to explore my projects, and let's connect!
